# analytics_studies
Here I share the tasks and case studies I completed during my data analytics studies. This plan can be used as a roadmap for Data Analysts. All the materials listed are those I have personally used (or currently using) and found valuable in my professional development.

### Plan
I developed a plan based on the key competencies for Data Analyst. The listed sources provide free courses and books to help enhance these skills:
